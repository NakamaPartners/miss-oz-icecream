# Verifying the Miss Oz site visually

The site mounts a fixed full-screen intro splash for ~1.5s (Loader component, z-999). The
Screenshot tool captures immediately on a fresh load, so it almost always catches the splash
("Miss Oz / est. 2007") instead of the page.

**To screenshot actual content:** temporarily flip the Loader's initial `useState(true)` → `false`,
screenshot, then flip it back. Don't forget to restore it.

# Hero layout constraint (overlap bug)

**Rule:** keep the hero as a single centered flex column with normal spacing — do NOT use negative
margins to pull the flavor title, tag badge, and cone stage together.

**Why:** an earlier version used `-mb` on the giant italic `<h1>` plus a negative `margin` on the
cone stage and pinned the flavor "tag" pill onto the stage. At large clamp() font sizes the title
collided with both the pill and the cone. User reported it as "texts overlapping / awkward."

**How to apply:** the flavor tag belongs BELOW the title as its own centered element; cap the h1 at
~clamp(40px,8.2vw,100px) with line-height ~1.06. Decorative motion (sunburst/seal spins, bob,
twinkle, marquee) must stay gated behind `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` (CSS uses
`#hero * { animation: none !important }`) and the auto-advancing carousel interval is skipped when
that media query matches.
